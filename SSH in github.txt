In GitHub, an SSH key is a way to securely connect and authenticate between your local machine (computer) and your GitHub account. SSH, which stands for Secure Shell, is a cryptographic network protocol used to secure communication over an unsecured network. GitHub uses SSH keys to establish a secure connection between your local machine and GitHub, allowing you to interact with repositories using the SSH protocol.
